# Let's talk about how we can run this test by ourselves.
# You can open the code inside a python compiler and what you will have to do 
# is to insert the name of your output file (eg: timefor10elements.csv), 
# insert the ammount of list to be sorted (larger number for a better precision(eg:100) if you 
# compute the average of the running time for every sorting algorithm, but for more than 10.000 elements
# you should reduce the preision (the lists to be sorted) so you get a faster running time of the algorithm),
# and finally insert the size of the lists to be generated and sorted.
# Every single sorting algorithm is sorting the same generated list so we can see better the difference in time
# execution.
